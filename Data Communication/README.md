# Ford GoBike Trip Data Exploration
## by Oluwaseyi SALAMI


## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike trip dataset contains info about 180,000+ bike rides made over a month (February 2019) in a ride-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Each ride has features/characteristics recorded in 16 columns. These features include the ride duration in seconds, trip start and end times, start and end/destination station, station location and other info about bike users as well as whether the trip was shared. It can be downloaded [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)

> Wrangling was done to remove rows with missing and invalid values as well as outliers. Some column names were changed to more pertinent/shorter descriptions, and new columns were feature engineered as needed during exploration. Columns with inappropriate datatypes were also converted to their correct types.


## Summary of Findings

> The number of rides taken peaked during daily rush hours. Ride volume was highest on Thursdays and lowest during the weekends. Customers and female riders had relatively longer rides and male riders were older. Younger riders were more likely to take shared trips and undergo evening rides


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For the presentation, I focus on the key trends that can be observed from the data. I start by introducing the
trip duration variable and its distribution, followed by the trends in how rides are distributed daily and weekly.
I then introduce patterns seen on bivariate exploration. To start,
I use adapted bar and point plots to depict the relationship between average trip duration, average age and gender or customer type.
I then use multivariate plots that show a continuation of the previous trends when viewed across other categories.
